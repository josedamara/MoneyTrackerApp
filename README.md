# Money Tracker Project

## A Brief Description

Money Tracker is an application with the functionality of **tracking one's cash flow** between each account, including both income and expenses. For cash flow between accounts, it will only change the money values in both accounts without affecting the total amount of money.

This application will be useful for everyone, especially for a person who wants to track their cash flow. Not only for an individual, this application will be beneficial as well for a company and organization because they need to track their money flow to prevent any money loss untracked.

This project is based on my habit of tracking my cash flow using a digital application on my mobile phone. However, there are some limited capabilities of the application that push me to create this project by myself and add a feature that I think would give a better experience to the user.
